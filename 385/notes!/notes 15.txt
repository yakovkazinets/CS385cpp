A spanning tree of an undirected connected graph is its connected a cyclic subgraph (ie tree) that contains all the vertices of the graph.
If such a graph has weights assigned to its edges, a minimum spanning ttree is its spanning tree of the smallest weight, where the weight of a tree
is defined as the sum of the wights of all its edges.

run time:

adjanceny matric + unordred array priority queue Theta(v^2)

adjanceny list + min heap priority queue O(E log V)

	Deletion, insertion, decrease-key O(log V)
	
	|v| for building a heap

	|v| -1 for deletions of the smallest element
		
	|E| comparisons - sum of the lengths ofa l adjacency lists is 2|E| <- bc undirected uses 2 edges to rep both ways

O(|V+E| log V) but in a conneccted graph |V| - 1 <= |E| ==> O(E log V)
